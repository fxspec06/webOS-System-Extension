webOS-System-Extension
======================

Dashboard notifications, keyboard, enyo.windows, and more



This package allows for certain special enyo 1.0 packages and events for use with enyo 2.0 on the hp touchpad.

Use on other devices is not tested but may also work.

This package requires Jason Robitaille's "webos-ext" package [add url].

I have not yet found a way to receive window activation or relaunch events, although I have achieved this once by fluke and have not been able to reproduce.

{kind: "Dashboard"}, enyo.keyboard, enyo.addBannerMessage, enyo.fetchAppInfo.. all these are working flawlessly.
