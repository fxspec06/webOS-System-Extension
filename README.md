webOS-System-Extension
======================

Dashboard notifications, keyboard, enyo.windows, and more



This package allows for certain special enyo 1.0 packages and events for use with enyo 2.0 on the hp touchpad.

Use on other devices is not tested but may also work.

This package requires Jason Robitaille's "webos-ext" package [add url].

*****APPLICATION EVENTS AND WINDOW EVENTS NOW WORKING.
======================================================

{kind: "Dashboard"}, enyo.keyboard, enyo.addBannerMessage, enyo.fetchAppInfo.. all these are working flawlessly.

Just so everyone knows, I plan on updating this file with more info when I have time.
